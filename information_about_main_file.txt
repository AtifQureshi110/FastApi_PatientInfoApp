🔍 Purpose:
This is your main FastAPI app setup, where:

app = FastAPI() creates the app instance.

You usually include HTML rendering, form handling, and frontend logic here.

Often handles:

Home page (GET /)

Form page (e.g., a patient submission form)

Form submission logic (e.g., POST /submit)

Example route here might use Request, Jinja2Templates, or Form() to receive input from frontend.

🧠 Use Case:
This is typically used when you're:

Building an HTML form-based web interface.

Handling data from templates (e.g., Jinja2).

Not using APIs directly, but frontend pages.
